## Steps to get run locally
1 - run: ```npm install``` to install dependencies.  
2 - run in dev mode: ```npm run dev``` (recommended)

In dev mode, you can run and edit on the fly. Changes are detected and redeployed. Alongside with POSTMAN you can 
then explore and test your API in a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) and develop fast!

## Prerequisites
 - Node 14+ installed locally.
